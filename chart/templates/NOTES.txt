ðŸ”¥ Congratulations, your cluster should be up in a few minutes ðŸš€

You can check the status of your cluster with 
    clusterctl describe cluster -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "hcloud-clusterapi.fullname" . }}

As soon as the ControlPlane status is True you can grab the kubeconfig with
    clusterctl get kubeconfig  -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "hcloud-clusterapi.fullname" . }} > ~/.kube/{{ include "hcloud-clusterapi.fullname" . }}

For a quick sanity check run 
    KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/{{ include "hcloud-clusterapi.fullname" . }} kubectl get pods -A
